# Cosmic_Journey

Cosmic Journey is a 2D JS canvas game inspired by the traditional Snake game, where the player controls a snake with randomly changing colors and attempts to survive the longest possible in an enclosed space, without biting itself. 

## Introduction
Are you mighty enough to sail through the quasars? The longer you survive, the greater the amount of your rewards. Use your arrow keys to travel. You will change color once in a while and leave a trail of this color. Be careful! Do not let your head hit a trail that is the same colour or hit the space barriers!

## Instructions
1. Use arrow keys to move. 
2. Avoid hitting the barriers or tiles (your trail) of the same color as your head.
